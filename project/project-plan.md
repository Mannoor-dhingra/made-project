# Project Plan

## Title
Exploring the relationship between world forest data with global temperature data

## Main Question
How does the change in forest areas affect the global temperatures on a yearly basis?

## Datasources
### 1. World Forest Area (km and %)
- **Source**: [World Forest Area](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/world-forest-area)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **License**: World Bank Dataset
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about the world's forest area changes since 1990. Studying global forest area changes is crucial for assessing environmental health, informing conservation strategies, and understanding the impact of human activities on biodiversity and climate regulation.

### 2. All Countries Temperature Statistics 1970-2021
- **Source**: [All Countries Temperature Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdazizulkabirlovlu/all-countries-temperature-statistics-1970-2021)
- **Data Type**: CSV
- **License**: CC0: Public Domain
- **Description**: This dataset provides information on changes in global surface temperature across all countries from 1970 to 2021. It includes data on temperature variations over a 51-year period and is based on information from various sources, including weather stations, satellites, and ocean buoys.
