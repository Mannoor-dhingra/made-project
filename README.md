# Exploring the relationship between world forest data with global temperature data

The goal of this report is to examine how global temperature changes have impacted changes in forest area over the last thirty years. The aim is to analyze the global impact of temperature fluctuations on forest ecosystems by utilizing historical data on average temperature changes and forest area measurements between 1990 and 2021.
This report discusses the results of the analysis, providing details on the impact of temperature changes on the extent of forested areas. The visuals and statistical patterns talked about here give a better insight into the intricate relationship between climate change and forest ecosystems.

# Main Questions
1. How have global temperatures changed over the past three decades?
2. How has the forest area globally changed over the same period?
3. Is there a correlation between temperature changes and forest area variations?
4. What are the overall trends in the data?

# Analysis
This data analysis shows significant trends in global surface temperature changes and forest area variations. Over the period of 3 decades, global surface temperatures have consistently risen, with notable increases in recent years, highlighting the ongoing issue of global warming. Along with this, forest areas have fluctuated but overall shown a decline, particularly during periods of significant surface temperature increases. The data shows a definite negative relationship between changes in surface temperatures and the amount of forest cover; higher surface temperatures lead to less forest cover, which is indicative of the detrimental effects of climate change on forests. The overall trends confirm that rising surface temperatures contribute to forest degradation.
